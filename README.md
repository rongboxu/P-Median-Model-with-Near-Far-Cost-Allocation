# P-Median Model with Near-Far Cost Allocation

This repository focuses on implementing the P-Median model with near-far cost allocation within the spopt package. It also includes a notebook that introduces this model and provides usage guidelines.

This newly developed model is a contribution to the spopt as part of Google Summer of Code 2023.

## Summary List:
1. Enhance p-median.ipynb with Capacitated P-Median Case:
2. Implement k-Nearest P-Median Model using PuLP
3. Integrate k-Nearest P-Median Model into spopt:
4. Develop test for the new model
5. Complete code documentation

All the work above is shown in this [pull request](https://github.com/pysal/spopt/pull/387).
