    "# K Nearest P Median Problem and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The P-Median Model with Near-Far Cost Allocation, alternatively known as the k nearest p-median Problem, offers a distinctive twist on the traditional p-median problem. This approach enhances our capability to effectively address location allocation challenges. In this notebook, we'll dive into the problem's formulation, and showcase the implementation of the `KNearestPMedian` class in the `spopt` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the K Nearest P-median Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The k nearest p-median problem extends the concept of facility location allocation by considering both nearest and non-nearest facilities. In the article by Church (2018), it proposed this new p-median model which can distinguish between near and far facilities, use both explicit and implicit variables for capacity allocations. By integrating this model, the `spopt` package becomes equipped to deliver heightened precision and efficiency in solving spatial optimization problems, especially those involving extensive datasets and substantial demand volumes."

Additionally, the resultant distances will be stored in a format of a **sparse matrix**, optimizing memory utilization, particularly for extensive datasets.\n",
