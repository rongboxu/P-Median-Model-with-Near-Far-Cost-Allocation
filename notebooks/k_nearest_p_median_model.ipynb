    "# K Nearest P Median Problem and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The P-Median Model with Near-Far Cost Allocation, alternatively known as the k nearest p-median Problem, offers a distinctive twist on the traditional p-median problem. This approach enhances our capability to effectively address location allocation challenges. In this notebook, we'll dive into the problem's formulation, and showcase the implementation of the `KNearestPMedian` class in the `spopt` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the K Nearest P-median Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The k nearest p-median problem extends the concept of facility location allocation by considering both nearest and non-nearest facilities. In the article by Church (2018), it proposed this new p-median model which can distinguish between near and far facilities, use both explicit and implicit variables for capacity allocations. By integrating this model, the `spopt` package becomes equipped to deliver heightened precision and efficiency in solving spatial optimization problems, especially those involving extensive datasets and substantial demand volumes."
