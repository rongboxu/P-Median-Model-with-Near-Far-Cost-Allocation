    "# K Nearest P Median Problem and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The K Nearest P Median problem presents a unique twist on the classical P Median problem, enabling us to address location allocation challenges more effectively. In this notebook, we'll dive into the problem's formulation, explore the role of k nearest facilities, placeholder facilities, and sparse matrices, and showcase the implementation of the `KNearestPMedian` class in the `spopt` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the K Nearest P Median Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The K Nearest P Median problem extends the concept of facility location allocation by considering both nearest and non-nearest facilities. In the article by Church (2018), it proposed this new p-median model which can distinguish between near and far facilities, use both explicit and implicit variables for capacity allocations. By implementing this model, the `spopt` package can provide more accurate and efficient solutions to spatial optimization problems, typically for the problems with large data points, and large demand volume.\n",
